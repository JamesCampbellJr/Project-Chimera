# ProjectChimera
Project Chimera is a personal AI assistant that lives on your computer. It sees what you see, listens to your voice commands, and can take control of your mouse and keyboard to help you with any task. What makes it unique is its ability to autonomously spawn specialist agents to learn new skills on the fly, just by researching them online.
